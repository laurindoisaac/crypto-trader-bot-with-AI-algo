# Crypto Trader Bot with AI algo (ver. 1.05)
In 2017, I started trading, thinking I would become the next Warren Buffett. I made hundreds in profit but then gave most of it back when the bear market hit. Clearly, I was not cut out for trading!
I can now turn my trading ideas into working code in just a few minutes, backtest them to see if they actually work, and confidently launch them for live trading if I like the results.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Architecture Overview
The application is built on a modular, agent-based architecture designed for scalability and resilience.

- Orchestrator (trading_bot.py): The central brain of the application. It manages the main event loop, state transitions (e.g., AWAITING_SIGNAL, IN_POSITION), and coordinates all other agents.
- Agents (agents.py):
- OrderExecutionAgent: Handles all aspects of order placement, sizing, and communication with the Kite API. Implements the "Isolated Worker Pattern" to ensure thread-safe order execution.
- PositionManagementAgent: Manages active trades, applying stop-loss, trailing stop-loss, and other risk management rules.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Architecture OverviewIntelligence Layer:

- langgraph_agent.py: Interfaces with the Gemini LLM to select strategies.
- sentiment_agent.py: Fetches and analyzes news to determine market sentiment.
- market_context.py: Identifies current market conditions (VIX, IV, etc.).
- rag_service.py: The RAG engine that retrieves historical performance from logs to augment the AI's prompts.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Strategy & Indicators:

- strategy_factory.py: A library of all trading strategies.
- indicator_calculator.py & indicators.py: Calculate all necessary technical indicators.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Reporting & Persistence:

- reporting.py: Manages the generation and emailing of performance reports.
- output/: Directory where trade logs and backtest results are stored.
